A C library made for Arduino, Sanguino and other ATmega microcontrollers. 
A collection of functions form the Internat as well as my own contributions.
The migration to C programming should be the next step for those who started with the Arduino
and the Wiring language. 

I tried to make it as easy as possible but there is always space for improvement.

Tools used:
- Eclipse (Indigo) for AVR
- Atmel AVR Toolchain for Linux
- avrdude 6.x
- ATmega328P (Arduino UNO), ATmega644P (Sanguino), ATmega168P
- Arduino bootlader (Optiboot) for all tested microcontrollers

```
