# atmega-clib
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/atmega-clib

A C library made for Arduino, Sanguino and other ATmega microcontrollers. 
A collection of functions form the Internat as well as my own contributions.
The migration to C programming should be the next step for those who started with the Arduino
and the Wiring language. 

I tried to make it as easy as possible but there is always space for improvememnt.
